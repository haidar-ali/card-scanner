## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cardscanner.git
cd cardscanner

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Development

```bash
# Start in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run make

# Package without making installers
npm run package
```

## Usage

1. **Scanner Tab**: 
   - Position the card's set code and number in view
   - Click "Capture" or upload an image
   - OCR will extract the text
   - Card data is fetched automatically

2. **Collection Tab**:
   - View all your scanned cards
   - Search and filter by set, rarity, etc.
   - Click cards for detailed view
   - Export collection to CSV

3. **Settings Tab**:
   - Configure camera preferences
   - Manage database backups
   - Customize display options

## How It Works

1. The app uses OCR to read the set code and card number (e.g., "FDN/1")
2. This information is sent to the Scryfall API
3. Complete card data is retrieved and stored locally
4. Your collection is saved in a local SQLite database

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera not working**: Make sure to grant camera permissions
- **OCR not accurate**: Ensure good lighting and clear view of text
- **Card not found**: Manually enter set code and number
